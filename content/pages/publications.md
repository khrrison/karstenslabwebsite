        tagline: ''
        subtitle: October 2022
        text: "### Abstract\n\nWhen creating figures, it is important to consider that individuals with color vision deficiency (CVD) may not perceive all colors. While there are several CVD-friendly color palettes, they are often insufficient for working with microbiome data. Here, we introduce microshades, an R package for creating CVD-accessible microbiome figures.\n\nDOI:\_[10.1128/mra.00795-22](https://doi.org/10.1128/mra.00795-22)\n\n"

          Concordance of urinary microbiota detected by 16S ribosomal RNA
          amplicon sequencing vs expanded quantitative urine culture

          ### Abstract


          Multiple techniques exist for characterizing the urinary microbiome.
          Two commonly used methods include expanded quantitative urine culture
          (EQUC) and 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing (16S sequencing).
          Even with enhanced techniques, culture-based methods may still fail to
          detect several organisms that are difficult to grow\.1,2 Sequencing
          methods also have limitations, such as failure to identify organisms
          with thick cell walls (eg, Gram-positive bacteria) owing to
          inefficient cytolysis.3 Given that each method of investigating the
          urobiome may present intrinsic biases toward detecting specific
          organisms, we aimed to compare the results between EQUC and 16S
          sequencing when both methods were performed on the same samples.

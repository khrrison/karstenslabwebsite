      Lisa Karstens, PhD is an Assistant Professor at Oregon Health & Science
      University in the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical
      Epidemiology (Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine)
      with a joint appointment in Obstetrics and Gynecology (Division of
      Urogynecology). She received her PhD in Chemistry from Princeton
      University prior to completing post-doctoral work in Bioinformatics and
      Urogynecology at OHSU. As faculty, she has been awarded the Oregon BIRWCH
      K12 career development award to investigate the urinary microbiome in
      women with overactive bladder syndrome, followed by an NIH NIDDK K01
      Research Scientist Development Award to understand the functional
      contribution of the urinary microbiome to the bladder.


      Dr. Karstens’ research interests broadly span using bioinformatics to
      understand the complex relationship between the human microbiome and
      disease, with a focus on women’s health and bladder disorders. Current
      research includes development of bioinformatic tools and novel integrative
      multi-omic approaches (such as metagenomics and metabolomics) to improve
      the analysis of microbial communities and microbiome function to ascertain
      the clinical utility of microbiomes. To accelerate the impact of her work,
      she collaborates with clinicians and molecular biologists on a variety of
      projects, including the role of microbiome in rheumatic, neurologic,
      behavioral, and gynecologic disorders.


      Dr. Karstens has a passion for teaching and mentoring as evidenced by a
      number of students ranging from high school to postdoctoral and medical
      fellows in her lab. She is involved with several outreach programs to
      engage underrepresented minority students and early career scientists in
      biomedical research, such as BUILD EXITO, and regularly participates as a
      mentor for summer research experiences. She teaches an introductory
      programming course in Python, as well as guest lectures on bioinformatic
      approaches and algorithms for studying the human microbiome.
